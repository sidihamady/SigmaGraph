SigmaGraph is a data plotting and analysis software designed to be lightweight, reliable and easy to use.  
SigmaGraph runs on Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7/8/10. SigmaGraph offers almost all the functionality needed by scientists and engineers:  
* editable datasheets (column properties, create series, set column values by using any mathematical expression, show column statistics, import/export from/to ASCII file, mask and unmask cells, printing, etc.);
* scientific graphing with a complete control of the graph (line/symbol style, colors, fonts, legends, axis properties, grid, tick, labels, scale, auto scale, log/linear scale, zoom in/out, copy format to another graph, export
as image, printing, graph templates, etc.);
* curve fitting (24 models including linear, polynomial, exponential, Gaussian (up to 5 peaks), Lorentzian (up to 5 peaks), Pearson VII, logistic, power, etc.);
* error bars (percentage, constant or any user defined data); drawing tools (line,rectangle, ellipse); mathematical console;
* powerful scripting engine; customizable script editor with syntax highlighting, code completion, etc.

SigmaGraph is now open-source and released under the MIT license since its version 2.6.10.

## Install

To install SigmaGraph just copy the portable binary distribution from the Dist\SigmaGraph directory to any location (such as usb key)
and run SigmaGraph.exe (located in the bin directory). The binary distribution is also available as an archive: https://github.com/sidihamady/SigmaGraph/blob/master/Dist/sigmagraph_windows.zip.
The SigmaGraph documentation is included in the help directory.

## Build

SigmaGraph uses the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) and Visual C++ (VC). The last VC version I used (and still using now (2018)) was Visual C++ 2013.

If you do not have VC already installed, download the Community version of VC (included in Visual Studio) with the MFC libraries.

All the build process is handled by the batch file msvcbuild.bat.  
Edit msvcbuild.bat to adapt it to your VC configuration. Open the solutions to upgrade to the installed VC release.  
The MFC is statically linked to the SigmaGraph modules.

When ready, open a VC developper command prompt and run msvcbuild.bat.  
The binary distribution is built and copied to the Dist\SigmaGraph directory.  
Just copy this distribution directory ( Dist\SigmaGraph ) to any location (usb key for instance) to use SigmaGraph.  

SigmaGraph consists of the following modules (each in a separate VC solution):  
* LibCalc: Mathematical and scientific routines and the Lua engine.
* LibGraph: 2D plotting core.
* LibScintilla: Lua editor control.
* SigmaConsole: the mathematical expression-based calculator.
* SigmaGraph: the SigmaGraph main module.

I have been commenting the code, sometimes in french and in english sometimes. As far as possible, I will translate everything to english.
