<p>SigmaGraph is a data plotting and analysis software designed to be lightweight, reliable and easy to use.<br>
SigmaGraph runs on Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7/8/10. SigmaGraph offers almost all the functionality needed by scientists and engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li>editable datasheets (column properties, create series, set column values by using any mathematical expression, show column statistics, import/export from/to ASCII file, mask and unmask cells, printing, etc.);</li>
<li>scientific graphing with a complete control of the graph (line/symbol style, colors, fonts, legends, axis properties, grid, tick, labels, scale, auto scale, log/linear scale, zoom in/out, copy format to another graph, export<br>
as image, printing, graph templates, etc.);</li>
<li>curve fitting (24 models including linear, polynomial, exponential, Gaussian (up to 5 peaks), Lorentzian (up to 5 peaks), Pearson VII, logistic, power, etc.);</li>
<li>error bars (percentage, constant or any user defined data); drawing tools (line,rectangle, ellipse); mathematical console;</li>
<li>powerful scripting engine; customizable script editor with syntax highlighting, code completion, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>SigmaGraph is now open-source and released under the MIT license since its version 2.6.10.</p>

<h2><a id="Install_20"></a>Install</h2>
<p>To install SigmaGraph just copy the portable binary distribution from the Dist\SigmaGraph directory to any location (such as usb key)<br>
and run SigmaGraph.exe (located in the bin directory). The zipped binary distribution is also available to download here: <a href="https://github.com/sidihamady/SigmaGraph/blob/master/Dist/sigmagraph.zip">Dist/sigmagraph.zip</a>.<br>
The SigmaGraph documentation is included in the help directory.</p>
<h2><a id="Build_27"></a>Build</h2>
<p>SigmaGraph uses the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) and Visual C++ (VC). The last VC version I used (and still using now (2018)) was Visual C++ 2013.</p>
<p>If you do not have VC already installed, download the Community version of VC (included in Visual Studio) with the MFC libraries.</p>
<p>All the build process is handled by the batch file msvcbuild.bat.<br>
Edit msvcbuild.bat to adapt it to your VC configuration. Open the solutions to upgrade to the installed VC release.<br>
The MFC is statically linked to the SigmaGraph modules.</p>
<p>When ready, open a VC developper command prompt and run msvcbuild.bat.<br>
The binary distribution is built and copied to the Dist\SigmaGraph directory.<br>
Just copy this distribution directory ( Dist\SigmaGraph ) to any location (usb key for instance) to use SigmaGraph.<br>
The zipped binary distribution is also available to download here: <a href="https://github.com/sidihamady/SigmaGraph/blob/master/Dist/sigmagraph.zip">Dist/sigmagraph.zip</a></p>
<p>SigmaGraph consists of the following modules (each in a separate VC solution):</p>
<ul>
<li>LibCalc: Mathematical and scientific routines and the Lua engine.</li>
<li>LibGraph: 2D plotting core.</li>
<li>LibScintilla: Lua editor control.</li>
<li>SigmaConsole: the mathematical expression-based calculator.</li>
<li>SigmaGraph: the SigmaGraph main module.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been commenting the code, sometimes in french and in english sometimes. As far as possible, I will translate everything to english.</p>
